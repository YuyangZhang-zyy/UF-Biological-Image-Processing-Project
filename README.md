One of the pipeline (pipeline.ipynb) uses lung's histology image and CODEX image to mark different cell types and map them to the histology image. 

Another pipeline (nuclei_seg.py and overlay.py) accepts a kidney's histology image containing glomeruli as input and outputs a kidney image with different nuclei types marked with color. 

These two pipelines would help researchers to more easily classify cells in large images.
